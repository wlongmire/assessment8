  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `GET` a list of agents from the Field Agent API when the component is first loaded
  * [ ] Write JSX to render the agents array
  * [ ] Stub out click event handlers ("Add Agent", "Edit Agent", "Delete Agent") as necessary

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

### Part 2: Add Agent and Delete Agent

* [ ] Create a form to add an agent
  * [ ] Add form JSX
  * [ ] Decide between using individual state variables for input elements or a single object
  * [ ] Add onChange event handlers to input elements

  * [ ] Create agent object
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `POST` the new agent's information to the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!), or on failure, display any validation errors from the API in the UI

* [ ] Support deleting agents
  * [ ] Store the "delete agent ID" in a new state variable
  * [ ] Retrieve the agent to delete
  * [ ] Update form state variable(s)
  * [ ] Add delete confirmation JSX
  * [ ] Add button click handler to perform the delete
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `DELETE` the agent from the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!)

* [ ] Conditionally render sections of the component
  * [ ] Add state variable to track the current view
  * [ ] Add conditional logic to the JSX to display the appropriate view

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

### Part 3: Edit Agent

* [ ] Support editing agents
  * [ ] Store the "edit agent ID" in a new state variable
  * [ ] Retrieve the agent to edit
  * [ ] Update form state variable(s)

  * [ ] Update the agents list
  * [ ] Update the add agent form
  * [ ] Update the edit agent form

## High-Level Requirements

Implement a full CRUD UI for agents.

* Display all agents
* Add an agent
* Update an agent
* Delete an agent

## Technical Requirements

* Use Create React App
* Use `fetch` for async HTTP
* You are not allowed to change the Field Agent HTTP Service or database (unless there's a confirmed bug and your instructor approves)
